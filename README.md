## **Working of the Code**

### **1. Image Search and Download**
- The app uses **SerpAPI** to search for images based on the userâ€™s input.  
- The images are **downloaded** to a folder named **"images"**.  
- To ensure a clean workflow, the app **clears the folder** after each search, preventing old images from being included in subsequent downloads.  

---

### **2. Zipping the Images**
- After downloading the images, they are **compressed** into a single ZIP file using the Python **`zipfile`** module.  
- This ensures that all downloaded images are packaged neatly for easy sharing.  

---

### **3. Email Sending**
- Using the **smtplib** library, the app **sends the ZIP file** as an attachment to the recipientâ€™s email.  
- The senderâ€™s email and app password are **hardcoded** for simplicity in this implementation.  

---

This streamlined workflow ensures the app functions efficiently, providing a seamless experience for searching, downloading, and sharing images. ðŸš€
